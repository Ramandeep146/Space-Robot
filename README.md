A 2D game in which a robot can shoot in any direction to kill the enemies and achieve the highest score. Flying enemies can also shoot fireballs to kill the player (Robot).
- Implemented object oriented programming design with three level grandparent-parent-child hierarchical/inheritance class objects.
- Used array list to store enemies, bullets and fireballs.
- Applied push and pop stack structure to properly associate hierarchical objects to build gestures for 2D transformation.
